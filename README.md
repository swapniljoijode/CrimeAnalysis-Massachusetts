# üöî Crime Analysis - Massachusetts üìä

This project involves the analysis of crime data in Massachusetts for the years 2021 and 2022. The data was scraped, cleaned, and stored in a SQL database, followed by an analysis and visualization using Tableau.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze crime trends and patterns in Massachusetts over the span of two years. The project involved the following steps:
1. **Data Scraping**: Crime data was scraped from the official website using Python.
2. **Data Cleaning**: The scraped data was cleaned and prepared for analysis.
3. **Data Storage**: Cleaned data was uploaded to an MSSQL Server.
4. **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis was conducted using SQL queries.
5. **Visualization**: Tableau was used to create a dashboard for visual representation of the crime data.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python (GUI: PyCharm)**
  - Libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `selenium`, `requests`, `zipfile`, `os`
- **MSSQL Server (GUI: SSMS)**
  - Views created using SSMS GUI
- **Tableau**
  - Used for dashboard and reports. The Tableau dashboard provides insights into crime trends and patterns in Massachusetts, with graphical representations of various crime-related information.
- **Git**
  - For version control and collaboration

## Data Source

The data was obtained from the [FBI's Crime Data Explorer](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/downloads).


## üìù NOTE
The views created in SQL Server were constructed using the drag-and-drop feature of SSMS. The code for view creation will be uploaded to the repository soon.
This project is a work in progress and may undergo changes in the future. All updates and changes will be documented in this repository.
